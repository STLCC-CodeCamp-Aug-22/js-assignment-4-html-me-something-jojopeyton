            <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Outriders is a fun mix between a third&#8209;person shooter and an action RPG. You and up to 2 other players can explore different areas on planet Enoch and fight monstrous creatures, insurgents, or overpowered bosses that rely heavily on their abilities.
               Other than using your guns to mow down your foes, you can use your class&#8209;based abilities in conjunction with your teammates' to produce different methods of attack.
               At the start, players create their characters and choose from four different classes, each with their own unique skillset that players can use. </p>

               <p>Technomancers use a variety of abilities that can present them as either a super&#8209;powered artillery heavy damage dealer or a crowd control&#8209;focused support character.
                   Technomancers also have the ability to heal their teammates with their class powers.</p>

                   <p>Pyromancers are a medium&#8209;range character that do damage via fire&#8209;based abilites. They can shoot a beam that does high damage, emit firewalls across the battlefield, and also set up Thermal Bombs. Pyros can recover their health whenever enemies are marked and killed by their abilites.</p>

                   <p>Devastators are tank&#8209;like characters that rely on gravity and Earth&#8209;based powers. They excel in close-quarter combat as they can use ground pounds like the Hulk and even encase themselves in armor made of rock. </p>

                   <p>And last but certainly not least, the Trickster. Tricksters are a hit-and-run, close&#8209;quarter combat character. They can utilize a variety of moves like a slashing maneuver that can heavily damage multiple enemies, as well slow down time, and even teleport right behind a single enemy to get close for a melee attack.</p>

                   <p>Each class has access to different special powers that can be used in various ways during battle. As you level up throughout the game, you'll unlock new abilities. Also, you'll reach new levels of power by using class points to unlock new skills via 3 master paths.
                     The game has different types of firearms and wearable equipment that can be attached. The strength of your equipped firearms and class abilities determine how much damage you do. Throughout the game you'll be able to harvest materials that can be taken to vendors and put towards upgrading current equipment and unlocking new gear.</p>

                     <h3>Review</h3>
                     <p>I'm currently on my second custom character and played over 50+ hours on this game. The story overall is pretty mediocre and at times can get kind of boring. The story also leaves multiple plot holes and questions that aren't answered throughout the game. The storyline just ends up leaving players' puzzled. 
                        The gameplay on the other hand is action&#8209;packed and full of different ways to approach a battle. The endgame quests and crazy bosses is enough to keep a lot of player's coming back. In conclusion, I recommend Outriders to anybody that likes a third-person shooter with a Destiny feel.</p>
